# Multiboy

It has long bothered me that there is no Gameboy emulator that properly supports multiplayer on the same system. There are some options, but they are not as plug-in-play as I would want them to be.

This emulator will offer the following features:
- Insanely good controller support.
- Each player can play a different game or play the same game together.
- Each player has their own saves.
